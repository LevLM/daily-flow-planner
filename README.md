Author:  Lev Lisus  

# Project Description
DailyFlowPlanner is a simple application designed for efficient task and schedule management.  
It combines elements of a to-do list and a calendar, allowing users to manage their daily activities flexibly by adjusting deadlines and priorities.  
The main idea was to create something useful for everyday life, especially for people who like to stay organized.

# Key Features  
- Simple and intuitive graphical interface (built with Swing)
- Easy to launch using an executable JAR file 
- Ability to add, edit, and delete tasks
- Each task has a title, deadline, status, and priority
- Flexible deadline management
- Task filtering: view only today's tasks or all; filter by completed/active
- (In development) Task types: task, reminder, meeting
- (In development) Reminders for tasks due today
- (In development) Improved sorting and viewing options
- Tasks are storing in a file using object serialization, allowing to save and load complete task objects with all fields

# Technologies and Tools

- IDE: Eclipse  
- Build System: Maven  
- GUI: Swing  
- Data Storage: Serialized file (tasks.dat)  
- Version Control: GitHub (the code must be executable from the repository)  
- Distribution Format: Executable JAR file
